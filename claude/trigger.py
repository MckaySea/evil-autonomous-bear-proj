"""One-shot gesture trigger: one bear dance per shown gesture.

Perception events arrive only when a label changes, so a held hand, a face
change, or a flickering hand would otherwise re-fire. OneShot filters that.
Duck-typed: an event only needs a `.gesture` string (barnaby's PerceptionEvent fits).
"""

ANY = "any"  # Any detected hand (every label except "none") counts as the gesture.


class OneShot:
    """Fire once when `gesture` is shown, then stay quiet until re-armed.

    After a fire, it fires again only when `cooldown_s` has passed since that
    fire AND the gesture was absent for at least `rearm_s` before being shown
    again. Expression is ignored. The cooldown should be the length of one bear
    dance: measure it on the real bear (Fri build), then set it.
    The caller passes `now` (seconds, monotonic); this class does no I/O or timing.

    `gesture="any"` matches every hand label except "none". With
    `repeat_while_held`, a hand that stays up fires again each time the cooldown
    passes, so the caller must feed every inference, not only label changes.
