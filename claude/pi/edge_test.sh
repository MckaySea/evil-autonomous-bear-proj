# edge_test.sh [TESTNAME ...] — find WHICH contact edge/state of the "Try Me" pigtail makes the bear dance.
#
# Setup: relay module is active-HIGH (SIG HIGH = relay contact CLOSED = like pressing Try Me).
# Data so far: short close pulses (open -> close 0.3-3 s -> open) did NOT dance (maybe bad wiring);
# the SDA1 pattern (held closed -> open 0.3 s -> closed and held) danced 3/3; Tony remembers that
# touching the bare wires and pulling them apart danced on the RELEASE.
#
# Usage:  edge_test.sh                 # all tests, in order T1..T6
#         edge_test.sh hold_release T5 # selected tests (name or T-number), in the given order
# Env:    SIG=2     BCM pin driving the relay (default 2 = SDA1; its permanent pull-up means rest = CLOSED)
#         GAP=25    seconds between tests (Try Me lockout ~22 s); not scaled
#         DRY=1     no GPIO, no voice: print only ("(dry) close/open")
#         SCALE=1   multiplies every hold duration (tests use 0.01)
#         LOG=...   log file (default ~/tony-tests/edge_test.log, appended)
# Every edge prints "HH:MM:SS.mmm EDGE close|open" so "bear started at X" can be matched to an edge.
#
# Tests (each starts from a defined state held 3 s so a previous edge cannot leak in):
#   T1 tap               open(3s) -> CLOSE 0.3 s -> RELEASE, open 8 s
#   T2 hold_release      open(3s) -> CLOSE 5 s   -> RELEASE, open 8 s
#   T3 hold_only         open(3s) -> CLOSE, stay closed 10 s (no release)
#   T4 blip_open         closed(3s) -> RELEASE 0.3 s -> CLOSE, closed 8 s  (the SDA pattern that worked)
#   T5 release_only      closed(3s) -> RELEASE, open 10 s
#   T6 long_hold_release open(3s) -> CLOSE 10 s  -> RELEASE, open 8 s
#
# Hypothesis table (Y = predicts a dance, and at which edge). CLOSE = SIG rising, RELEASE = SIG falling.
#   test                | CLOSE edge (rising) | RELEASE edge (falling) | needs held closure (>~1 s)
#   T1 tap              | Y at CLOSE          | Y at RELEASE           | N
#   T2 hold_release     | Y at CLOSE          | Y at RELEASE           | Y during hold (or at RELEASE)
#   T3 hold_only        | Y at CLOSE          | N                      | Y during hold
#   T4 blip_open        | Y at re-CLOSE       | Y at RELEASE           | Y after re-CLOSE
#   T5 release_only     | N                   | Y at RELEASE           | N
#   T6 long_hold_release| Y at CLOSE          | Y at RELEASE           | Y during hold (or at RELEASE)
# Discriminators: T3 vs T5 (close-only vs release-only), T1 (short closure), T2/T6 timing (CLOSE vs RELEASE).
# Caveat: tests T4/T5 start CLOSED for 3 s; a "held closure" or CLOSE trigger may fire in that setup
# phase. Note it against the EDGE timestamps rather than counting it for the test.
#
# Safety: relay/SIG only. Wheels untouched, no camera. Never touches any pin other than $SIG;
# on exit/interrupt SIG returns to rest (SIG=2: input pull-up = closed; other pins: input pull-down = open).
